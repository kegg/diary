Life doesn't always have to make sense. Somedays it makes no sense at all. 
That's all which matters actually. If it doesn't make sense, wait a day and then 
it might make sense to you. If it makes sense then you are doing alright that 
day.

So sleepy today. I don't know how else to describe it. Just so very very sleepy.
