Kinda sleepy today. Like really sleepy. Not sure why that is, but I am way too 
sleepy for anything. It would be nice to be able to figure this out. All the 
sleepy.

Being sleepy isn't the best feeling in the world. Sometimes you just don't feel 
up to doing anything, and that is a weird place to be.
