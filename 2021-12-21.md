Life comes and goes. We are here for a moment and then gone the next. Somedays 
this life feels like it's a pain to live. Other days it feels like life is okay. 
I cannot explain half of the thoughts that come into my mind.

I feel like the walls are closing in on me. I can't further describe the pain it 
is I feel day in and day out. It is a thing that just doesn't make sense to me.
