Today wasn't the best of days. It could have been better. But who's to know what 
to do with any of it. No, this life will never cease to amaze me. It will get 
better somehow, I think. Maybe it will get better. There's no way of telling. I 
wish I could figure it all out in one failless blow, but I just don't think that 
will happen. So here I sit waiting for the inevitable to happen.
